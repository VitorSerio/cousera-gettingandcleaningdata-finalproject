# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project

This project aims to clean and prepare the dataset from the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset to a *tidy* format. This format follows the rules defined by Hadley Wickham in his article *Tidy Data*. The rules are:  
<ul><li>Each variable forms a column.</li>  
<li>Each observation forms a row.</li>  
<li>Each type of observational unit forms a table.</li></ul>

Files discription:
<ul><li>run_analysis.R: R script with the code for processing the dataset stored in a folder called *UCI HAR Dataset* and creates archives storing the resulting tidy dataset in a folder called *Tidy Dataset*.</li>  
<li>CodeBook.md: Markdown file with the discriptions of the data generated by the R script and also some explanation on how the data was processed.</li></ul>
